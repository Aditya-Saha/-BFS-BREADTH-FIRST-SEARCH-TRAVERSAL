# BFS-AND-DFS-TRAVERSALS

Two of  THE CODE USED ADJACENCY LIST AS graph input . And other two used adjacency matrix.

BFS stands for Breadth First Search is a vertex-based technique for finding the shortest path in the graph. It uses a Queue data structure that follows first in first out. In BFS, one vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue. It is slower than DFS. 


DFS stands for Depth First Search is an edge-based technique. It uses the Stack data structure and performs two stages, first visited vertices are pushed into the stack, and second if there are no vertices then visited vertices are popped.
